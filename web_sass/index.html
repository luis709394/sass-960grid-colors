      <p>Suddenly the foremost Martian lowered his tube and discharged a canister of the black gas at the ironclad.  It hit her larboard side and glanced off in an inky jet that rolled away to seaward, an unfolding torrent of Black Smoke, from which the ironclad drove clear. To the watchers from the steamer, low in the water and with the sun in their eyes, it seemed as though she were already among the Martians.They saw the gaunt figures separating and rising out of the water as they retreated shoreward, and one of them raised the camera-like generator of the Heat-Ray.  He held it pointing obliquely downward, and a bank of steam sprang from the water at its touch.  It must have driven through the iron of the ship's side like a white-hot iron rod through paper.</p>

      <p>"Why, that isn't very far from Kansas!" cried Dorothy.</p>

<p>"No, but it's farther from here," he said, shaking his head at her sadly.  "When I grew up I became a ventriloquist, and at that I was very well trained by a great master.  I can imitate any kind of a bird or beast."  Here he mewed so like a kitten that Toto pricked up his ears and looked everywhere to see where she was.  "After a time," continued Oz, "I tired of that, and became a balloonist."</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked Dorothy.</p>

      <p>The three boys were now hard at it; and quite a knocking and hammering  arose, in which Granser babbled on unnoticed.</p>

<p>"You are true savages. Already has begun the custom of wearing human  teeth. In another generation you will be perforating your noses and  ears and wearing ornaments of bone and shell. I know. The human race  is doomed to sink back farther and farther into the primitive night  ere again it begins its bloody climb upward to civilization. When we  increase and feel the lack of room, we will proceed to kill one another.  And then I suppose you will wear human scalp-locks at your waist, as  well&mdash;as you, Edwin, who are the gentlest of my grandsons, have already  begun with that vile pigtail. Throw it away, Edwin, boy; throw it away."</p>

<p>"What a gabble the old geezer makes," Hare-Lip remarked, when, the teeth  all extracted, they began an attempt at equal division.</p>

       <p>My exhibition had been witnessed by several hundred lesser Martians, and they immediately broke into demands for a repetition, which the chieftain then ordered me to make; but I was both hungry and thirsty, and determined on the spot that my only method of salvation was to demand the consideration from these creatures which they evidently would not voluntarily accord.  I therefore ignored the repeated commands to "sak," and each time they were made I motioned to my mouth and rubbed my stomach.</p>

<p>Tars Tarkas and the chief exchanged a few words, and the former, calling to a young female among the throng, gave her some instructions and motioned me to accompany her.  I grasped her proffered arm and together we crossed the plaza toward a large building on the far side.</p>

<p>My fair companion was about eight feet tall, having just arrived at maturity, but not yet to her full height.  She was of a light olive-green color, with a smooth, glossy hide.  Her name, as I afterward learned, was Sola, and she belonged to the retinue of Tars Tarkas.  She conducted me to a spacious chamber in one of the buildings fronting on the plaza, and which, from the litter of silks and furs upon the floor, I took to be the sleeping quarters of several of the natives.</p>

<p>The room was well lighted by a number of large windows and was beautifully decorated with mural paintings and mosaics, but upon all there seemed to rest that indefinable touch of the finger of antiquity which convinced me that the architects and builders of these wondrous creations had nothing in common with the crude half-brutes which now occupied them.</p>

        <p>"What are you doing here?" I asked, "and what has happened to you since Hooja freed you from the Sagoths?"</p>

<p>At first I thought that she was going to ignore me entirely, but finally she thought better of it.</p>

<p>"I was again running away from Jubal the Ugly One," she said.  "After I escaped from the Sagoths I made my way alone back to my own land; but on account of Jubal I did not dare enter the villages or let any of my friends know that I had returned for fear that Jubal might find out. By watching for a long time I found that my brother had not yet returned, and so I continued to live in a cave beside a valley which my race seldom frequents, awaiting the time that he should come back and free me from Jubal.</p>

<p>"But at last one of Jubal's hunters saw me as I was creeping toward my father's cave to see if my brother had yet returned and he gave the alarm and Jubal set out after me.  He has been pursuing me across many lands.  He cannot be far behind me now.  When he comes he will kill you and carry me back to his cave.  He is a terrible man.  I have gone as far as I can go, and there is no escape," and she looked hopelessly up at the continuation of the ledge twenty feet above us.</p>

        <p>"Something must be done to save us.  I think I can swim to the shore and pull the raft after me, if you will only hold fast to the tip of my tail."</p>

<p>So he sprang into the water, and the Tin Woodman caught fast hold of his tail.  Then the Lion began to swim with all his might toward the shore.  It was hard work, although he was so big; but by and by they were drawn out of the current, and then Dorothy took the Tin Woodman's long pole and helped push the raft to the land.</p>

<p>They were all tired out when they reached the shore at last and stepped off upon the pretty green grass, and they also knew that the stream had carried them a long way past the road of yellow brick that led to the Emerald City.</p>

<p>"What shall we do now?" asked the Tin Woodman, as the Lion lay down on the grass to let the sun dry him.</p>
